Singular Protocol ($SNG)
Own Less. Control More.

Singular is a decentralized, community-governed investment protocol built on the immutable principle of absolute scarcity.

This repository contains the source code for the official Singular Protocol website, built with Astro.

The Vision
The Singular Protocol introduces a new economic primitive designed to combat the value dilution and misaligned incentives common in the DeFi space. Our core mission is to create a self-sustaining economic engine where the value of our native token, SNG, is directly and transparently backed by a growing portfolio of real, on-chain assets managed by the community.

Core Features
Absolute Scarcity: The protocol is built around a single SNG token, fractionalized into 100 million units. The supply is fixed and cannot be inflated.

Asset-Backed Value: The SNG token represents a direct claim on the treasury's Net Asset Value (NAV). Its value is tied to the performance of the assets we invest in, not just market speculation.

Aligned Governance: Our Voting Score system heavily rewards long-term commitment, ensuring that the most dedicated community members have the strongest voice in guiding our investment strategy.

Profit-Sharing Dividends: A complete value cycle where realized profits from successful investments can be distributed directly back to committed SNG holders.
