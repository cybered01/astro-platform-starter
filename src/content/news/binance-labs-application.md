title: 'Singular Applies to Binance Labs for MVB and Incubation Programs' pubDate: 2025-06-24 description: 'In a significant step towards accelerating its development, Singular has officially submitted applications to two of the most prestigious programs in the Web3 ecosystem.' author: 'The Singular Team'
In a significant step towards accelerating its development and ecosystem integration, the Singular Protocol has officially submitted applications to two of the most prestigious programs in the Web3 ecosystem: the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) accelerator and the BNB Incubation Alliance.

This move underscores our deep commitment to building a foundational economic primitive on the BNB Chain. Our mission is to create a decentralized investment fund that not only generates sustainable, asset-backed value for its members but also actively contributes to the growth and success of the entire BNB Chain ecosystem by identifying and funding its most promising new ventures.

"We believe that the future of DeFi requires robust, transparent, and value-aligned protocols," said the project's founder. "Our application to Binance Labs is a testament to our confidence in the Singular model. We are not just building a token; we are architecting a new system for decentralized capital formation, and there is no better partner than the team that has been instrumental in building the industry itself."

The selection process for both programs is highly competitive, and this application marks the beginning of a new phase for Singular as we move from strategic planning to active development and community growth.

We invite our community to review our official whitepaper and join our social channels to follow our progress.

This is just the beginning.
