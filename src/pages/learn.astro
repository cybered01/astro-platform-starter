        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization run by code and controlled by its members, rather than a central authority. In Singular, this means that SNG token holders have the power to vote on every critical decision, from which projects to invest in to how protocol profits are distributed.</p>

      <!-- Question 2: Understanding Absolute Scarcity -->

        <summary class="flex justify-between items-center font-medium">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Why is Absolute Scarcity Important?</h2>
          <span class="transition-transform duration-300 group-open:rotate-180">
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7" /></svg>

        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>The total supply of Singular (1 token, divided into 100 million fractions) is permanently fixed. No more can ever be created. This means your ownership stake can never be diluted by inflation. As the value of the DAO's investment portfolio grows, the value of each scarce SNG fraction is positioned to grow with it.</p>

       <!-- Question 3: How Does Voting Work? -->
      <details class="group bg-gray-900/50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 cursor-pointer">
        <summary class="flex justify-between items-center font-medium">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">How Does Voting Work?</h2>
          <span class="transition-transform duration-300 group-open:rotate-180">
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7" /></svg>
          </span>
        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>Your voting power isn't just based on how many SNG fractions you own. Our unique `Voting Score` formula also rewards long-term commitment. By locking your tokens for a longer duration, you gain significantly more influence over the DAO's decisions, ensuring that the most dedicated members have the strongest voice.</p>

       <!-- Question 4: How Do Dividends Work? -->
      <details class="group bg-gray-900/50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 cursor-pointer">
        <summary class="flex justify-between items-center font-medium">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">What are Profit-Sharing Dividends?</h2>
          <span class="transition-transform duration-300 group-open:rotate-180">

        </summary>
        <div class="mt-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>When the DAO votes to sell a successful investment, the profits are returned to the treasury. The community can then vote to distribute a portion of these realized profits back to SNG holders. Your share of these dividends is proportional to your `Voting Score`, directly rewarding you for your long-term participation and effective governance.</p>
