        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The promise of cryptocurrency has always been to create a more equitable and transparent financial system. However, the current landscape is dominated by projects with vast, inflationary token supplies that dilute value and reward short-term speculation over long-term commitment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Singular's mission is to challenge this status quo. We are building a decentralized investment protocol anchored in the immutable principle of **absolute scarcity**. Our goal is to create a powerful, community-governed economic engine where value is not manufactured, but collectively built and fairly distributed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-6">The Vision: A Community-Owned Fund</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          We envision a future where the line between user, owner, and investor is blurred. Singular is not a company that builds products; it is a protocol that empowers its community to act as a decentralized venture capital fund.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          By holding SNG, you hold a stake in a treasury that invests in the next generation of web3 innovation. The collective intelligence of the DAO identifies and funds promising projects, and the success of those investments is directly reflected in the intrinsic value of your SNG. This creates a powerful flywheel: smart governance leads to smart investments, which leads to a more valuable protocol for everyone.
