      <!-- 1. Capital Allocation -->
      <Section title="Capital Allocation" subtitle="The Community as the Investment Committee">
        <p class="mb-6">The core function of the Singular DAO is to deploy capital from its treasury into promising new ventures. This process is entirely community-led, ensuring that every investment is transparent, vetted, and aligned with the DAO's long-term goals. The process follows a clear lifecycle:</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
            <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold">Proposal (SIP):</strong> Any project seeking funding must submit a formal Singular Investment Proposal (SIP). This standardized form requires details on their vision, team, tokenomics, and the specific amount of capital requested.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold">Community Vetting:</strong> The proposal is posted publicly on the DAO's governance forum. Here, the Singular community acts as a team of analysts, conducting due diligence, asking critical questions, and debating the merits of the potential investment.
            </li>
             <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold">Formal Vote:</strong> Proposals that gain strong community support move to a formal, binding vote on the governance portal. SNG holders use their weighted `Voting Score` to approve or reject the investment.
            </li>
             <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold">Deployment:</strong> If the vote passes, the requested capital is automatically transferred from the DAO's multi-signature treasury wallet directly to the project.
            </li>
        </ol>
      </Section>

      <!-- 2. Intrinsic Value Growth -->
      <Section title="Intrinsic Value Growth" subtitle="Backed by a Portfolio of Real Assets">
        <div class="bg-gray-900/50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 space-y-4">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">What is Net Asset Value (NAV)?</h3>
            <p>In the context of Singular, NAV is the total market value of all assets held within the DAO Treasury. These assets primarily consist of the native tokens from the projects the DAO has invested in, along with stablecoins and the protocol's own SNG reserves.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">How is NAV Calculated and Reported?</h3>
            <p>The NAV is calculated in real-time and displayed on a public-facing Treasury Dashboard. Every asset is accounted for, and its value is tracked via reliable price feeds. This radical transparency means anyone can verify the intrinsic value backing the SNG token at any moment. While the DAO does not undergo traditional audits, the on-chain nature of the treasury provides a provable, real-time audit for all to see.</p>
        </div>
      </Section>

      <!-- 3. Profit-Sharing Dividends -->
      <Section title="Profit-Sharing Dividends" subtitle="Rewarding Long-Term Governance">
         <div class="bg-gray-900/50 p-6 rounded-lg border border-gray-700 space-y-4">
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">How are Dividends Funded?</h3>
            <p>Dividends are funded exclusively from **realized profits**. When the DAO votes to sell a portion of a successful investment, the resulting profit (in stablecoins) becomes available. The community can then pass a Singular Profit Distribution (SPD) proposal to share a portion of these profits.</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Who is Eligible?</h3>
            <p>Eligibility and distribution weight are tied directly to your `Voting Score`. The longer you have locked your SNG tokens and the more you hold, the larger your share of the dividend payout. This system is designed to directly reward the most committed, long-term participants who contribute to the DAO's effective governance and, therefore, its investment success.</p>
